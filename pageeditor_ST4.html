                <p>When a user hovers over a thumbnail image, it 
                    should visually indicate that it's clickable, inviting 
                    interaction and  Upon clicking a thumbnail, it should expand to 
                    reveal an extended view with more detailed content also The extended view should display a larger version 
                    of the thumbnail image and include a detailed

                    <p>In this content page, I have added some basics of education and also I've added some text about the importance of books. In today's digital era, the importance of 
                        quality education is widely acknowledged as 
                        a fundamental pillar of societal progress and 
                        individual empowerment. Content pages 
                        dedicated to quality education and books 
                        play a pivotal role in disseminating 
                        knowledge, fostering intellectual growth, 
                        and promoting lifelong learning. </p>
